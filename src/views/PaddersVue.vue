                    <p>Padders is a product designed to help you keep track of what's in your fridge and where you are in your food consumption. It's a simple concept, but it can make a big difference in your fridge use. First, place your pads on your shelves. Then, place your food in their section based on its expiration date. You can start by doing like us: From red (close to the expiration date) to yellow(safe to keep a little longer) and green (safe to stay a while longer). And voil√†! Now you will know what to eat before it's too late and wasted.

<br>Here are some of the benefits of using Padders:</p>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Reduces waste: When your fridge is organized, you can see what you have and need to use up before it goes bad. This can help reduce food waste, save money, and ensure that you always use the freshest ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Saves time: When you know where everything is in your fridge, you can quickly grab what you need without searching through a cluttered mess. This can save you time and make meal prep and cooking more efficient.</li>
                        <li>Easy to use: Padders is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Place the pad in your fridge and place your food based on its expiration date. In no time, you can quickly identify where each item should be stored.</li>
                        <li>Customizable: Your fridge with Padders is customizable, so you can adjust it to fit your needs. For example, you can designate more space for fruits and vegetables if you have a lot of produce. If you prefer to keep your dairy products in a specific spot, you can simply place them.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Overall, Padders is a simple but effective solution for keeping your fridge organized.
